# Chat-astrophe
## A Multi-User chat app

This is a project from Course 4 Server-side Programming at CodeAbode.  This multi-user chat app takes advantage of several technologies:

-	[Express](http://expressjs.com/) - a lightweight framework for Node.js
-	[Socket.io](http://socket.io/) - a package for real-time communication using websockets and Node.js
